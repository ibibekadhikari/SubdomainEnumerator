# SubdomainEnumerator
This script is for someone who wants to automate their sudomain enumeration technique in an efficient way. I haven't done any hard scripting here but just a technique and implemented others tools to make it works.
Moreover, i just wanted to check for 200 Status code which means every working subdomain so you can change it accordingly by editing the .sh file if you want status code with, 301 Moved Permanently, 302 Moved Temprorarily, 404 Page not found, 403 Forbidden.

#Tools that are required.

1. Subfinder.
2. Httpx.

#USE.

* git clone https://github.com/ibibekadhikari/SubdomainEnumerator.git

* bash urlEnumerator.sh
